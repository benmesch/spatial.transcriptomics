![tissue slide, with overlay](README_files/screenshots/bc1.gif)

Load count data for breast cancer layer 1. For each of 254 locations on the tissue, load counts of 14,881 genes expressed at that location.  Source data from "Visualization and analysis of gene expression in tissue sections by spatial transcriptomics" (Stahl, Patrik, et al 2016). 

```{r}
st <- read.csv('Layer1_BC_count_matrix-1.tsv',header=TRUE,sep="\t")
dim(st)
```

Counts for 14,881 genes are listed for each of 254 locations:
```{r}
head(st[1:5,1:6])
```

The first column lists the coordinates of the locations:
```{r}
coordinates <- st$X
x <- as.numeric(substr(coordinates,1,as.integer(regexpr("x",coordinates))-1))
y <- as.numeric(substr(coordinates,as.integer(regexpr("x",coordinates))+1,nchar(as.character(coordinates))))

plot(x * 288.9, 9000 - y * 292.6,ylim=c(1000,8000),xlim=c(1500,7500)) #upscale coordinates (or can resize image down to 33x35)
```


# Using T-SNE to cluster locations
```{r}
library(Rtsne)
set.seed(1989)
#st_mat <- as.matrix(st[,-1])
reduced.dim <- Rtsne(st,dim=3)
```

Plot first 2 dimension results from T-SNE, and color using k-means(7)
```{r}
set.seed(1989)
clusters <- kmeans(reduced.dim$Y,7)$cluster
plot(reduced.dim$Y,col=clusters,asp=1)
```

# Overlay original tissue slide
Load stained image of breast cancer layer 1 (source: https://www.spatialresearch.org/resources-published-datasets/)
```{r}
library(magick)
full_img <- image_read('README_files/screenshots/HE_layer1_BC.jpg')
image_info(full_img)
```

Downscale and preview image:
```{r}
plot(image_scale(full_img, "1000"))
```

Annotate tissue image with clusters from tSNE-reduced gene counts:
```{r}
overlay <- image_scale(full_img, "1000")
cols <- c("red","green","blue","yellow","lime","magenta","wheat4")
dot.size <- 75
for (i in seq(1,length(x))) {
  xi <- x[i] * 288.9 * (image_info(overlay)$width/9245) #upscale to 9k x 9k, then downscale to 1k x 1k
  yi <- y[i] * 292.6 * (image_info(overlay)$height/9949)
  locationi <- paste("+",as.character(xi-dot.size/2)
                     ,"+",as.character(image_info(overlay)$height-yi),sep="")
  overlay <- image_annotate(overlay, "•", size = dot.size, gravity = "southwest", color = cols[clusters[i]], location=locationi)
}
plot(overlay)
```

The clusters can be used in the plot of x-y location coordinates from the tissue sample. (Save as a gif)
```{r}
test <- image_scale(c(full_img,full_img,overlay,full_img), "1000")
image_write(image_animate(image_morph(test, 10)), "README_files/screenshots/bc1.gif")
```

# Future
Computational geometry. 
https://www.cgal.org/projects.html#astronomy

One featured example that uses that package: taking redshift data and creating structure. Could perform similar operation to expression data? To create compartments of tissue based on different cell types in each subtissue component...
