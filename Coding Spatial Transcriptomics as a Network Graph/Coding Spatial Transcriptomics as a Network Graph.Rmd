# Code Spatial Tx as a Network Graph
May 25th, 2020. Dive into the data for a specific single cell and a single spatial sample which was enriched for that cell's cell type.

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(Seurat)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(igraph)
```

## Identify a target spatial sample
The spatial data is available publically from 10x Genomics. 1,072 spatially tagged samples for 47,094 genes.
```{r}
cortex_final <- readRDS('../2/cortex_final.rds') #342MB
```

Retrieve spatial sample coordinates and the cell type prediction results from an earlier anchor-based label transfer:
```{r}
d <- data.frame(cortex_final[['anterior1']]@coordinates[,c('col','row')])
d['row'] <- d['row'] * -1
colnames(d) <- c('x','y')
d <- cbind(d,t(as.matrix((cortex_final[['predictions']]@data))))
dim(d)
d[1:10,1:5]
```

## Convert spatial samples into a network graph
Manually set a cutoff Euclidean distance of 2.1
```{r}
test <- as.matrix(dist(data.frame(d[,1:2])))
typeof(test)
dim(test)

test[1:10,1:5]

hist(colSums((test)<2.1))

#count(which(as.numeric(test[,1]) <= 20))
#hist(colSums(test>0 & test<6))

test <- test>0 & test<2.1 #close neighbors only
hist(colSums(test))

```

```{r, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 12}
g <- graph_from_adjacency_matrix(test, mode="undirected")
 #iGraph plotting help: https://kateto.net/netscix2016.html
l <- as.matrix(d[,1:2])
plot(g, vertex.label=NA, vertex.size=1, layout = l) #layout_with_kk is pretty good too
```





### Verify that our target sample's neighbors are properly accounted for in the conversion to an adjaceny matrix and then to a network graph...
our target sample is at 61,-39
```{r}
target.sample <- "TGGCAGCAGTAATAGT-1"
d[target.sample,c('x','y')] #our target sample is at 61,-39
```

Neighbors:
```{r}
d[58 < d$x & d$x < 64 & -42 < d$y & d$y < -36,c('x','y')]

```

```{r}
d$color <- as.numeric(58 < d$x & d$x < 64 & -42 < d$y & d$y < -36) #the neighbors
d[target.sample,'color'] <- 9 #our target
table(d$color)
ggplot(d,aes(x,y,color = as.factor(color)))+
  geom_point()
```

Verify the 8 manually identified neighbors were all included in the automatically identified neighbors from the distance matrix:
```{r}
which(test[,target.sample]) #the adjacency matrix identified 5 neighbors that met the maximum distance threshold
names(which(test[,target.sample])) %in% rownames(d[58 < d$x & d$x < 64 & -42 < d$y & d$y < -36,c('x','y')]) #all 5 were in the group of 8 manually identified neighbors
```



```{r}
rm(cortex_final) #remove spatial cortex object from memory
```
